//! Geometric correctness harness.
//!
//! Loads every fixture in `FIXTURES`, runs the full router pipeline
//! against every spatial product, and asserts a small set of universal
//! invariants (mesh is non-empty when the fixture is supposed to have
//! geometry, no NaN/Inf, no extreme-aspect-ratio sliver triangles in
//! CSG-cut output, bbox stays inside a generous envelope).
//!
//! On `--nocapture` it prints a per-fixture summary table you can scan
//! against the viewer to lock baselines. Set `IFC_LITE_HARNESS_REPORT`
//! to a file path to also dump a machine-readable JSON report for
//! diff-on-regression workflows.
//!
//! Fixture set:
//!   * **buildingSMART IFC 4.3 Annex E** — every "example" in the spec's
//!     advanced/basic/mapped/tessellated geometric-shape pages. These
//!     are the canonical references for what a correct kernel must
//!     handle. Pulled from `buildingSMART/IFC4.3.x-sample-models`.
//!   * **Issue regression IFCs** — the three IFC attachments from
//!     geometry-bug reports that aren't already covered by per-issue
//!     tests (#424 IfcDerivedProfileDef, #218 window rendering, #472
//!     SurfaceModel support). The other two attachments (#674 door,
//!     #631 reinforcing bar) had 404 user-attachments URLs at fetch
//!     time and were skipped.
//!
//! Soft-pass by default: a missing fixture (e.g. when the test runs in
//! an environment without the full fixture set vendored) is logged but
//! does not fail the harness. Strict baselines for individual fixtures
//! belong in dedicated regression test files once their behaviour has
//! been visually verified.
//!
//! **Snapshot baseline (insta):** every *present* fixture additionally
//! pins its stable stats (mesh count, vertex/triangle totals, rounded
//! bbox + surface area, per-type counts) as a named `insta` snapshot in
//! `tests/snapshots/`. A silent geometry change fails CI with a diff
//! that pinpoints exactly which fixture moved; intentional improvements
//! are accepted with `cargo insta review` (or `INSTA_UPDATE=auto`).
//! Missing fixtures are skipped — no snapshot is asserted for them.
//! Only run-to-run-stable values are snapshotted; floats are rounded to
//! 3 decimals and `worst_aspect` is deliberately excluded (a max over
//! float ratios is too boundary-sensitive across platforms).
//!
//! Snapshots are pinned to the pure-Rust exact CSG kernel — the only
//! kernel on every target since #1024, so they are asserted
//! unconditionally.
