//! Manifold (https://github.com/elalish/manifold) CSG adapter.
//!
//! Replaces the legacy in-tree BSP port (`bsp_csg.rs`) with Google's
//! Manifold kernel for `subtract` / `union` / `intersection` on triangle
//! meshes. Removes the 24-polygon operand cap and produces
//! manifold-by-construction output.
//!
//! Gated behind the `manifold-csg` Cargo feature. While the migration is
//! in flight (Sprint 2 / T1.1) the legacy BSP remains the default path so
//! correctness and bundle-size budgets can be validated incrementally.
//!
//! Vertex normals are recomputed from positions after each operation:
//! Manifold tracks per-vertex properties separately and we don't yet
//! round-trip our normals through it.
//!
//! See `bsp_csg.rs` for the legacy alternative; the public surface here
//! mirrors its `union` / `difference` / `intersection` shapes via the
//! mesh-level wrappers in `csg.rs`.

/// 1. Build an `(min_v, max_v) → [(tri, direction)]` edge index over

/// 2. Cluster triangles into connected components via union-find over
///    shared edges. Each component (typically one per `IfcClosedShell`,
///    but an `IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids` ships one outer + N inner
///    shells) is oriented independently.
/// 3. Per component, pick a seed triangle that touches the vertex of
///    greatest extent along the component's longest axis. That vertex
///    is on the convex hull, so the seed's outward normal must have
///    a non-negative component along that axis. If the seed's normal
///    points the wrong way, flip the seed before propagating.
/// 4. BFS from the seed. For any two adjacent triangles, the shared
///    edge has to be traversed in OPPOSITE directions if both are

/// as-is:
///
/// 1. **Scar lines on coplanar surfaces.** Adjacent strips that SHOULD
///    share an edge sometimes carry near-coincident-but-not-identical
///    vertex coordinates from Manifold's internal arithmetic. Per-
///    vertex normal averaging then sees them as isolated faces with
///    slightly different face normals, so the boundary between strips
///    shades as a visible darker/brighter line across what's physically
///    one flat wall / slab / roof panel — the horizontal striations
///    users report when subtracting openings via Manifold on
///    `02_BIMcollab_Example.ifc` and similar BIM models.
/// 2. **Stretched / sliver triangles.** Floating-point boundary
///    intersections occasionally emit needle-thin triangles extending
///    far past the host geometry — they render as the long red "ray"
///    outliers shooting out of the building.
///
/// Post-process to fix both:
///
/// - Weld vertices that share a position within 10 µm. Manifold's own
///   tolerance is finer so we only collapse the numerical-noise
///   duplicates, never an authored vertex pair. The welded mesh has
///   each Manifold strip sharing edge vertices with its neighbours, so
///   the normal accumulator gets one identical face normal contributed
///   from every strip on the same plane → flat surfaces shade
///   uniformly.
/// - Drop triangles with any edge > 500 m. Real building elements
///   (long beams, retaining walls) stay well under that threshold; the
///   sliver outliers blow past it by orders of magnitude.
/// - Recompute area-weighted vertex normals on the welded, cleaned
///   mesh.
///
/// Welding is intentionally position-only — it does not consider face
/// orientation, so a vertex shared between two perpendicular faces
/// (e.g. wall-meets-floor) collapses to a single point with one
/// averaged normal. That softens the resulting crease slightly; a
/// crease-angle smooth-group pass for crisp corners is a follow-up.
