//! Make a mesh's per-triangle winding consistent and OUTWARD, per connected
//! component.
//!
//! IFC faceted breps (whose face loops are not reliably outward) and merged
//! multi-item bodies (an extrusion unioned with a boolean cut) can arrive with
//! MIXED per-triangle winding: some faces wound outward, some inward. That
//! corrupts signed volume (quantities) and the smooth normals
//! [`crate::csg::calculate_normals`] accumulates from the winding (lighting). The
//! kernel's whole-operand `orient_outward` only flips an ENTIRE mesh by its
//! global signed volume, so it cannot repair a mesh that is internally
//! inconsistent.
//!
//! [`orient_mesh_outward`] recovers face adjacency (the meshes are flat-shaded,
//! so positions are welded by a fine grid), propagates a consistent orientation
//! across shared edges per connected component, then flips each CLOSED component
//! so its signed volume is positive (outward). An OPEN component (a TIN /
//! `SurfaceModel` sheet with boundary edges — no meaningful enclosed volume) or a
//! non-manifold / non-orientable one is left untouched: re-orienting it is
//! ambiguous and would reverse authored normals. The winding-invariant geometry
//! hash and the summary snapshots are unaffected; only normals/quantities change,
//! which is the point.
