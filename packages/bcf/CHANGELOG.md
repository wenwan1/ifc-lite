### Patch Changes

- [#1548](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1548) [`ec89d3f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ec89d3f871f54b58fbfe32915ac6304505de1174) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix BCF round-trip data loss. On read, XML entities in titles, descriptions, comments, and labels are now unescaped, so `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` come back exactly as written instead of as literal entities. The comment parser no longer truncates every comment to an empty string: the outer `<Comment Guid="...">` wrapper shares its tag name with its nested `<Comment>` text field, so the parser now slices each wrapper's span up to the next wrapper (or end of markup) and takes the last `</Comment>` as its real close. That is robust across BCF 2.1 and 3.0 (where comments sit inside a `<Comments>` container) and tolerates unknown vendor elements, so no comment is silently dropped. On write, `BimSnippet` (when it carries the schema-required `ReferenceSchema`) and `DocumentReference` are now emitted; they were parsed and typed but never written, so they were silently dropped on every export.

### Patch Changes

- [#1036](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1036) [`0205c4d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0205c4d50995572ef796ce66877aa389f19c6fbc) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add a `default` condition to every package's exports map. The maps only
  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default
  condition path (tsx, jest, plain `require`, some bundlers) failed with
  ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. The `default` entry points at the same
  ESM dist file; pure ESM consumers are unaffected.

## 1.15.5

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

### Minor Changes

- 0191843: feat: Add BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) support

  Adds full BCF 2.1 support for issue tracking and collaboration in BIM workflows:

  **BCF Package (@ifc-lite/bcf):**

  - Read/write BCF 2.1 .bcfzip files
  - Full viewpoint support with camera position, components, and clipping planes
  - Coordinate system conversion between Y-up (viewer) and Z-up (IFC/BCF)
  - Support for multiple snapshot naming conventions
  - IFC GlobalId mapping for component references

  **Viewer Integration:**

  - BCF panel integrated into properties panel area (resizable, same layout)
  - Topic management with filtering and status updates
  - Viewpoint capture with camera state, selection, and snapshot
  - Viewpoint activation with smooth camera animation and visibility state
  - Import/export BCF files compatible with BIMcollab and other tools
  - Email setup nudge in empty state for easy author configuration
  - Smart filename generation using model name for downloads

  **Renderer Fixes:**

  - Fix screenshot distortion caused by WebGPU texture row alignment
  - Add GPU-synchronized screenshot capture for accurate snapshots

  **Parser Fixes:**

  - Extract GlobalIds for all geometry entities (not just spatial) to enable BCF component references

  **Bug Fixes:**

  - Fix BCF viewpoint visibility not clearing isolation mode
  - Add localStorage error handling for private browsing mode
  - Fix BCF XML schema compliance for BIMcollab compatibility:
    - Correct element order (Selection before Visibility)
    - Move ViewSetupHints to Components level (not inside Visibility)
    - Write OriginatingSystem/AuthoringToolId as child elements (not attributes)
    - Always include required Visibility element
