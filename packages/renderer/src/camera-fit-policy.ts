/**
 * Camera-fit policy: pick a target / distance / view direction appropriate
 * to the scene's bounding-box shape.
 *
 * Compact models (typical buildings, aspect <= LINEAR_ASPECT_THRESHOLD) keep
 * the historical south-east isometric pose with `maxSize * 2` distance — the
 * established BIM convention and the only thing the existing test suite has
 * pinned. Long-thin models (railway alignments, road corridors, anything
 * with bbox aspect > 50:1) get a "linear" policy: camera positioned at the
 * bbox centre, looking down-and-along the longest axis, distance chosen so
 * sub-metre features (signals, referents, kerbs) project to several pixels
 * rather than vanishing into a single pixel of the auto-fit frustum.
 *
 * The module is intentionally pure (no GPU / Camera / Renderer dependency)
 * so it can be unit-tested for every aspect ratio that matters and reused
 * by both the post-load auto-fit and the Home-view button without
 * duplicating the heuristic at each call site.
 *
 * iTwin.js civil viewers solve this same problem with a stationing
 * navigation mode that tracks the alignment direction. We approximate the
 * starting pose iTwin uses for the first frame.
