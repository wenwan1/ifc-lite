# @ifc-lite/extensions

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#874](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/874) [`e73ac09`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e73ac0931b85cd299ae9b723073e956b6b124c85) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Remove unused public exports that had zero consumers anywhere in the monorepo (coordinated breaking change). Each was verified against internal code, the other apps, the examples, the scaffolding templates, and the docs before removal.

  - **@ifc-lite/geometry**: drop `LODGenerator` / `LODConfig` / `LODMesh` (`lod.ts`), `DEFAULT_MATERIALS` / `getDefaultColor` / `getDefaultMaterialColor` / `MaterialColor` (`default-materials.ts`), and `calculateDynamicBatchSize`.
  - **@ifc-lite/parser**: drop `StyleExtractor` (and its `IFCMaterial` / `StyleMapping` types) and `OpfsSourceBuffer`.
  - **@ifc-lite/data**: drop `isBuildingLikeSpatialTypeName` — the enum-based `isBuildingLikeSpatialType` and the other spatial-type predicates stay.
  - **@ifc-lite/extensions**: drop `slugify` and `suggestedExtensionId`; the sibling id helpers (`suggestedCommandId`, `flavorImportedId`, `flavorMergedId`, `DEFAULT_FLAVOR_ID`) are retained.
  - **@ifc-lite/wasm**: drop the debug-only `debugProcessEntity953` / `debugProcessFirstWall` methods and the never-wired `scanEntityIndexShard` (Path C sharded-scan) export.

  Also removes the dead `ifc-lite-engine` crate (no workspace dependents) and the no-op `serde` feature on `ifc-lite-core` (it gated no code).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 2 authoring pipeline — parsing, repair loop, diagnostics.

  Closes 5 more plan tasks (P2.T8, T9, T10, T16, T17). The chat-side
  authoring loop now has every library piece it needs to drive the LLM
  through plan → bundle → validate → repair → install.

  - **`authoring/synthesize.ts`** (T8/T9/T10) — `parseBundleOutput`
    extracts fenced `ifc-extension-manifest` / `ifc-extension-code` /
    `ifc-extension-widget` blocks from a chat response into a
    structured bundle. Manifest + widget JSON parsed; code stays as
    text. Surfaces structured errors on missing path attributes,
    duplicate manifest blocks, code-without-manifest. Bug found during
    development: the original regex used `\s+` for the attribute
    separator which greedily ate the JSON via `\n` matching as
    whitespace — fixed to `[ \t]+`, reproducer in tests.

  - **`authoring/repair.ts`** (T16) — `runRepairLoop` drives the
    authoring loop: calls the LLM `AuthoringStep`, validates the
    response (manifest + widgets + code + cross-references +
    capabilities), feeds structured diagnostics back as a user turn,
    retries up to `maxAttempts` within `totalBudgetMs`. Per-attempt
    wall-clock budget enforced via promise race. Defensive copies of
    the conversation passed to the step so callers can't mutate the
    internal buffer.

  - **`authoring/repair.ts:validateBundleResponse`** — single-pass
    validation: manifest → widgets → code → cross-reference. Used by
    both the repair loop and by callers that just want to validate an
    output without retrying.

  - **`authoring/diagnostics.ts`** (T17) — `groupDiagnostics` /
    `renderDiagnostics` / `summariseDiagnostics`. Groups errors by
    leading scope (handles both JSON paths and file paths
    correctly), renders markdown-ish blocks for the chat UI, produces
    short summaries for toasts / headers.

  Tests: 504 (up from 482 / +22). New test files: `synthesize.test.ts`,
  `repair.test.ts`, `diagnostics.test.ts`. Two real bugs caught by
  tests during development — the fence-regex greedy-eat and the
  diagnostic scope leading-segment split.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Flavor `.iflv` packing + prompt overlay helpers + plan-stub generator.

  Closes 4 more plan tasks on the library side. All host-agnostic, fully
  tested headlessly.

  - **`flavor/packer.ts`** (P3.T7, P3.T9) — `packFlavor(flavor, opts)`
    produces a gzipped JSON `.iflv` envelope embedding the flavor plus
    optionally each extension's `.iflx` bytes. `unpackFlavor(bytes)`
    validates the envelope, runs the flavor through `validateFlavor`,
    and surfaces decoded extension bundles. Same deterministic-output
    guarantee as `.iflx`. Strict base64 decode hardens against silently
    corrupted payloads.
  - **`flavor/overlay.ts`** (P4.T11) — `clampOverlay(content)` trims +
    applies the 4000-token soft cap (configurable) before persisting the
    personal prompt overlay; `overlayParagraphDiff(prev, next)` lets the
    memory-extractor UI highlight added vs. removed paragraphs.
  - **`miner/plan-stub.ts`** (P4.T7) — `planFromPattern(pattern)`
    translates a mined `MinedPattern` into an `AuthoringPlan` skeleton:
    one command + one toolbar contribution; capabilities unioned from a
    conservative per-intent map; one fixture-bound smoke test; notes
    field attributes the pattern occurrence count and last-seen time.

  Side fix: `signing/base64.ts:fromBase64` is now strict (length % 4,
  regex-validated alphabet). Was lenient before; corrupted payloads
  would silently decode to garbage on Node. Matches the bundle/iflx
  hardening from the PR-review pass.

  Tests: 445 (+24 across 3 new test files). All source files under 400
  lines.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 1 UI finish + Phase 2 authoring kernel + Phase 4 integration.

  Closes 14 plan tasks across three phases. Big-impact session — the
  extensions system is now reachable end-to-end on the web: chat →
  script → promote → review → install → command-palette → toolbar →
  audit-log.

  **Phase 1 — UI finish:**

  - **P1.T8 command palette merge** — `CommandPalette.tsx` now reads
    `commandPalette` slot contributions, surfaces them under a new
    "Extensions" category, and dispatches via the new `runCommand`
    host method.
  - **P1.T9 toolbar slot** — `ExtensionToolbarSlot.tsx` renders
    `toolbar.right` contributions with `when`-clause visibility
    evaluation against a viewer-state context; mounted in `MainToolbar`.
  - **P1.T11/T12 promote-to-tool** — `PromoteToolDialog.tsx` button in
    `ScriptPanel.tsx` (Sparkles icon next to Save). Reads the editor
    source, infers a minimal capability set via `inferCapabilities`,
    synthesises a single-command bundle (manifest + handler wrapper),
    routes through `CapabilityReview` for the security gate, installs.
  - **P1.T17 audit log UI** — `AuditLogPanel.tsx` with kind filter
    chips, per-event tones, JSON export, clear. Toggled inside the
    Extensions panel header.

  **Phase 2 — AI authoring kernel:**

  - **P2.T1 intent classifier** — `authoring/classify.ts`. Rule-based
    routing: one-shot / authoring / fork / out-of-scope. Refusal
    matchers for path-traversal, shell-exec, npm-install, and
    exfiltration phrasing.
  - **P2.T3 plan card** — `PlanCard.tsx` renders an `AuthoringPlan`
    with editable summary, contribution removal, capability opt-out,
    risk-tier badges, and test summary. Approve/cancel route to host.
  - **P2.T6 authoring contract prompt** — `authoring/prompt.ts`.
    `buildAuthoringContract()` returns the static, cacheable prompt
    fragment: manifest schema, widget DSL table, capability catalogue
    with risk tiers, style rules, test convention, failure modes.
    Deterministic for cache-hit reliability.
  - **P2.T20/T21/T22 widget renderer** — `widget/WidgetRenderer.tsx`
    walks the 15 DSL node types into matching React components. Data
    bindings resolve via JSONPath-ish `"$.foo.bar"`. Buttons dispatch
    through a `WidgetRendererContext.invokeCommand` callback so
    widgets stay command-id-driven (no closures, no inline scripts).

  **Phase 3 — saved-scripts migration:**

  - **P3.T15** — `flavor/migrate-scripts.ts`. `migrateSavedScripts(scripts)`
    produces a starter flavor + per-script synthetic extension bundles.
    Capability inference per script; conservative fallback to
    `model.read`. Tests cover slug stability, namespace override,
    parse-failure skip.

  **Phase 4 — self-improvement integration:**

  - **P4.T6 filter against installed** — `miner/filter.ts`.
    `filterAgainstInstalled` drops mined patterns the user already has
    an extension covering, based on a capability → intent reverse map.
  - **P4.T8 idle scheduler** — `miner/scheduler.ts`. `IdleMineScheduler`
    re-arms a debounced timer on every action-log push, fires the
    miner on idle, respects a min-interval floor, dispatches scored
    patterns to subscribers.
  - **P4.T12 system prompt overlay** — `system-prompt.ts` (viewer)
    appends the active flavor's prompt overlay inside a dedicated
    cacheable trailing section.

  **Viewer host service:**

  - `ExtensionHostService.runCommand(id)` — looks up the owning
    extension, activates it (idempotent), loads the entry handler
    source, wraps with `wrapEntrySource`, runs in the sandbox.

  Tests: 482 (up from 445 / +37). All source files under the 400-line
  cap. No new test files for UI components (Vercel preview verifies);
  new test files: `authoring/classify.test.ts`, `authoring/prompt.test.ts`,
  `flavor/migrate-scripts.test.ts`, `miner/scheduler.test.ts`,
  `miner/filter.test.ts`.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Introduce `@ifc-lite/extensions` package and the `ifc-lite ext` CLI
  subcommand — the Phase 0 foundation of the user-customization /
  AI-authored-extensions system designed in
  `docs/architecture/ai-customization/`.

  The package exposes:

  - **Manifest validator** — hand-rolled, dependency-free; produces
    structured `{ path, code, hint }` errors for use by the future
    AI repair loop.
  - **Capability grammar** — parser, matcher, OCAP catalogue, risk
    classifier, and set-diff for re-consent flows.
  - **`when` clause language** — parser + evaluator for the slot
    visibility expressions used by host UI.
  - **`SlotRegistry`** — in-memory pub/sub for contribution points;
    the substrate for Phase 1's host UI bindings.
  - **Bundle loader and `.iflx` pack/unpack** — directory and gzipped
    JSON envelope variants, deterministic round-trip.

  The CLI adds `ifc-lite ext validate <path>` (returns structured JSON
  with `--json`) and `ifc-lite ext init <dir>` (scaffolds a minimal
  valid bundle).

  No host integration yet. UI loader, runtime activation, sandbox
  wiring, audit log, AI authoring, flavors, and self-improvement loops
  arrive in subsequent phases.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 1 — end-to-end `entry.activate(ctx)` execution.

  The activation runtime now actually runs extension entry scripts. The
  calling convention for v1 is settled:

  - Entry files are **plain JavaScript** that define a top-level function
    matching the entry name (`activate`, `deactivate`, or a command
    handler id).
  - The function takes a `ctx` parameter; for v1, `ctx = { bim }` only.
    Future ctx fields (`fetch`, `storage`, `notify`, `onDispose`, `t`,
    `meta`) hang off the same contract — no rewrite required.
  - ES module syntax (`import`, `export`) is **not supported** in v1.
    The source-wrap parser rejects it with structured errors; the CLI
    scaffold writes the right shape.
  - Async user code is fire-and-forget at activation: the IIFE may
    return a Promise (`activateResult.value`), but the runtime does not
    await it. Long-running work belongs on command/trigger fires.

  Three new modules:

  - **`host/source-wrap.ts`** — wraps user source as an IIFE that
    installs `__ifclite_ctx__` and `bim`, then invokes the entry
    function. Validates with acorn; rejects `import`/`export`
    statements before the sandbox ever sees the code.
  - **`host/memory-factory.ts`** — `createMemorySandboxFactory()`. Host
    realm `new Function()`-backed factory for headless tests. **Not a
    security boundary** — documented in-file. Production hosts use the
    QuickJS factory that ships with the viewer.
  - **`host/runtime.ts`** (extended) — `ExtensionRuntime.activate(id, grants, bundle)`
    reads the entry script from the bundle, wraps it, runs it, captures
    logs + duration + return value. Disposes the sandbox on any
    failure. `deactivateWithBundle` mirrors the flow for the optional
    `entry.deactivate` script.

  Test count: 307 (up from 269 / +38). The activation flow tests use
  the in-memory factory to exercise the full pipeline end-to-end —
  bundle in, IIFE out, activateResult captured. The viewer-side QuickJS
  factory adapts `Sandbox.eval` to the same `RuntimeSandboxHandle.run`
  shape; that wiring lands with the UI integration.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 1 — extension activation runtime (security layer).

  Three new host-side modules:

  - **`host/permissions.ts`** — `capabilitiesToPermissions(grants)`
    derives the existing `@ifc-lite/sandbox` permission flags from a
    fine-grained capability set. This is the **outer ring**: a
    whole-namespace gate the sandbox enforces.
  - **`host/runtime.ts`** — `ExtensionRuntime` manages a sandbox per
    active extension. Uses a pluggable `RuntimeSandboxFactory` so the
    viewer can wire `@ifc-lite/sandbox` in while tests / CLI use stubs.
    Idempotent activate / deactivate / disposeAll.
  - **`host/check.ts`** — `checkMethodCall` / `assertMethodCall` /
    `CapabilityDeniedError`. The **inner ring**: per-`bim.<ns>.<method>`
    capability check used by the future bridge wrapper. Defence in depth
    — even if the sandbox flag would allow the call, the method-level
    check refuses it without an explicit capability grant.

  The runtime does **not** yet invoke `entry.activate(ctx)` — that
  requires settling a cross-realm `ctx` calling convention for QuickJS
  (the existing sandbox uses globals, not parameter passing). That
  design lands with the viewer-side UI wiring. The runtime exposes the
  sandbox handle so the host can drive script evaluation when ready.

  Test count: 269 (up from 231 / +38). Coverage includes every
  capability scope's permission derivation, the activation lifecycle,
  idempotence, factory error propagation, and the inner-ring method
  check for both pass and deny paths.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 1 Stage A — host-agnostic library layer for the extension system.

  New modules:

  - **Storage** (`/storage`) — `ExtensionStorage` interface,
    `InstalledExtensionRecord` type, `InMemoryExtensionStorage`
    implementation for tests/CLI, SHA-256 bundle hashing via WebCrypto.
  - **Host** (`/host`) — `ExtensionLoader` (composes storage + manifest
    validation + slot registry + activation dispatcher), and
    `ActivationDispatcher` (event-driven at-most-once activation per
    session, with sequential async listener semantics).
  - **Audit** (`/audit`) — append-only ring buffer with byte + count
    caps, JSON export, filter API for the future security review UI.
  - **Inference** (`/inference`) — acorn-based AST walker that turns a
    saved script into a minimum capability set for the "Promote to tool"
    UX. Conservative: ambiguous calls over-grant rather than under-grant.

  Dependencies added: `acorn` and `acorn-walk` (tiny, standard ES parser
  used by ESLint/Webpack/Babel; chosen over zero-dep regex to avoid
  under-granting on edge cases).

  UI integration (viewer-side React provider, Promote-to-Tool dialog,
  capability review screen, Settings → Extensions page) and the
  sandbox capability bridge are intentionally not in this changeset.
  They land in the next batch where browser interactivity is verifiable.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Viewer UI integration for the extension system (Phase 1 UI batch).

  Web-reachable surface: the Settings page is desktop-only, so the
  extension surface is now a togglable right-dock panel reachable from
  the Command Palette ("Extensions"). It mirrors how IDS / BCF / Lens
  panels are surfaced.

  New viewer modules (`apps/viewer/src/`):

  - `services/extensions/idb-storage.ts` — IndexedDB-backed
    `ExtensionStorage` implementing the package interface. Two object
    stores keyed by `id` and `<id>@<version>`. Recovery rebuild on
    schema mismatch (mirrors `services/ifc-cache.ts`).
  - `services/extensions/sandbox-factory.ts` — adapts
    `@ifc-lite/sandbox.createSandbox` to the package's
    `RuntimeSandboxFactory`. Maps `run` to `Sandbox.eval`, threads
    `setGlobal` through prepended assignments, marshals log entries.
  - `services/extensions/host.ts` — `ExtensionHostService` singleton:
    composes storage + slot registry + activation dispatcher + extension
    runtime + audit log behind one facade. Exposes `init`,
    `previewBundle`, `installFromBytes`, `uninstall`, `setEnabled`,
    `listInstalled`, slot subscriptions, change signal.
  - `sdk/ExtensionHostProvider.tsx` — React context built on top of
    `BimProvider`; service identity is stable across renders.
  - `hooks/useSlotContributions.ts`, `hooks/useInstalledExtensions.ts` —
    thin reactive hooks.
  - `components/extensions/ExtensionsPanel.tsx` — dock panel: install
    via drag-drop / file picker, list with enable/disable/uninstall.
  - `components/extensions/CapabilityReview.tsx` — modal with per-row
    risk badges (green/yellow/red), opt-out per capability, typed
    "approve" confirmation for red-tier grants.
  - `store/slices/extensionsSlice.ts` — `extensionsPanelVisible` toggle
    state.

  Wired into existing surfaces:

  - `App.tsx`: `<ExtensionHostProvider>` wraps the routed content
    inside `<BimProvider>`.
  - `ViewerLayout.tsx`: renders `ExtensionsPanel` on both desktop and
    mobile branches when visibility flag is set.
  - `CommandPalette.tsx`: new "Extensions" entry under the Panels
    category that exclusively activates the dock panel and uncollapses
    the right panel.

  Package-side change: `@ifc-lite/extensions/audit/log.ts` —
  `AuditLog.append`'s input type now uses `DistributiveOmit` so per-kind
  fields (`reason` on `unhealthy`, `previousVersion` on `update`) stay
  visible to TypeScript without call-site casts.

  Tests still 307 (no new test additions this turn; viewer-side React
  Testing Library coverage lands with the user's browser verification
  pass). No regressions in any of the 22 existing test files.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Library-layer ground for Phase 2 / Phase 3 / Phase 4.

  This batch fills in the host-agnostic data layers across three phases.
  No viewer/CLI integration in this changeset — the UI surfaces hook into
  these in subsequent work.

  **Phase 3 — Flavors (`/flavor`):**

  - `types.ts` — `Flavor`, `FlavorExtension`, `SavedLens`, `SavedQuery`,
    `KeybindingOverride`, `LayoutOverride`, `PromptOverlay`,
    `FlavorAuthor`, `FlavorSnapshot`.
  - `schema.ts` — hand-rolled `validateFlavor` mirroring the manifest
    validator pattern.
  - `diff.ts` — structured `diffFlavors(theirs, ours)` producing
    per-section diffs (extensions / lenses / saved queries /
    keybindings / settings / prompt overlay).
  - `merge.ts` — three-way `mergeFlavors(base, theirs, ours)` with
    conflict surfacing. Extensions union by id with higher-semver
    version + capability intersection; settings per-key with
    base-aware resolution; prompt overlay appended with separator.
  - `storage.ts` — `FlavorStorage` interface + `InMemoryFlavorStorage`
    with auto-snapshot on every write (cap configurable) and
    active-flavor pointer.

  **Phase 4 — Action log + miner (`/log`, `/miner`):**

  - `log/types.ts` — `ActionEvent` discriminated union over
    ~18 intent kinds (model.load, lens.apply, export.run, ...) with
    intent-specific `params` schemas. Privacy by construction —
    params hold metadata, never content.
  - `log/writer.ts` — `ActionLog` append-only buffer with UTF-8
    byte cap, count cap, deep-frozen records, subscribe API for
    reactive observers, JSON export.
  - `miner/sequence.ts` — `mineSequences` finds frequent n-gram
    intent patterns per session, filtered by occurrence + distinct-
    session thresholds. `splitSessions` separates events by
    configurable gap.
  - `miner/score.ts` — `scorePattern` combines frequency × recency
    × session diversity with exponential decay; `topPatterns` ranks
    for the suggestion UI.

  **Phase 2 — library bits (`/authoring`, `/widget`, `/validate`):**

  - `authoring/plan.ts` — `AuthoringPlan` schema + `validatePlan`.
    Holds `summary`, `rationale`, `contributions`, `capabilities`,
    `triggers`, `widgets`, `tests` for the plan-before-code UX.
  - `widget/schema.ts` — declarative widget DSL: 15 node types
    (Stack, Group, Text, Field, Button, Table, Chart, Markdown,
    Tabs, Separator, EmptyState, Spinner, ErrorBanner, EntityList,
    Tree, KeyValueGrid). `validateWidget` walks the tree.
  - `validate/code.ts` — acorn-based AST walker rejecting banned
    globals (`globalThis`, `window`, `process`, `document`, `self`),
    banned calls (`eval`, `Function`), and dynamic `import()` with
    non-literal specifiers or unauthorised paths.
  - `validate/cross-ref.ts` — `crossReferenceBundle` confirms entry
    paths, widget paths, lens / exporter / IDS validator handlers
    resolve; optionally validates test fixture ids against a
    catalogue.

  Top-level barrel exports each new module group via `export *`.

  Plan completions (13 tasks): P2.T2, P2.T11, P2.T12, P2.T19;
  P3.T1, P3.T2, P3.T3, P3.T10, P3.T12; P4.T1, P4.T2, P4.T4, P4.T5.

  Tests: 421 (up from 337 / +84). New test files:

  - `flavor/flavor.test.ts` (18 cases)
  - `log/log.test.ts` (12 cases)
  - `miner/miner.test.ts` (9 cases)
  - `widget/widget.test.ts` (11 cases)
  - `validate/code.test.ts` (13 cases)
  - `validate/cross-ref.test.ts` (10 cases)
  - `authoring/plan.test.ts` (6 cases)

  All source files under the 400-line cap.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 3 + 4 completion — flavor switcher, test runner, SDK
  revalidation, memory extractor, miner integration.

  Library additions across this batch:

  - **Test runner** (`testing/runner.ts`, `testing/synthetic.ts`):
    `runBundleTests` drives a bundle's declared `manifest.tests` against
    the existing `ExtensionRuntime`. Matchers: mimeType / byte range /
    regex / jsonShape. Synthetic fixtures provide a content-free
    `bim` ctx with `query.byType` + `query.count` so tests can run
    without real IFC files. Canonical residential-small /
    office-medium / empty-model included.
  - **Dry-run profile** (`dryrun/profile.ts`): RFC §02.5 budgets
    (25 % memory, 50 % CPU of production) for the authoring loop's
    transient runtime.
  - **SDK version + revalidation** (`host/sdk-version.ts`,
    `host/sdk-revalidate.ts`): hand-rolled semver-lite matcher and the
    revalidate orchestrator that re-runs manifest tests for every
    installed extension whose engine range no longer matches the
    candidate SDK.
  - **Flavor switcher** (`flavor/switcher.ts`): three-step
    enable/disable/load orchestration with full rollback on any failure
    (deactivate throw, reload returning false, pointer-write failure).
  - **Memory extractor** (`flavor/memory-extractor.ts`): rule-based
    preference scanner over chat transcripts with a strict content
    blocklist (GUIDs, paths, emails, API keys). `mergeIntoOverlay`
    seeds a Preferences section and deduplicates.
  - **Eval suite** (`eval/loops.test.ts`): end-to-end coverage of the
    three §06 loops — planted-pattern miner, memory-extractor leak
    prevention, SDK-update flagging.

  Test count: 558 across 49 files, all passing.

- [#690](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/690) [`8b22fc0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8b22fc048da4fa94abbb5298aa509d90ab53cb2d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phase 5 prototype — Ed25519 signing for extension bundles.

  The hosted registry is gated on a decision criterion (50 flavors / 10
  authors before opening), but the cryptographic kernel ships today so
  the design isn't abstract and authors can sign bundles before any
  registry exists.

  New design doc:
  `docs/architecture/ai-customization/10-registry-and-signing.md` —
  distribution threat model, signing scheme, key management, signed
  envelope shape, verification flow, registry architecture sketch,
  trust UX (TOFU), revocation, phase 5 build plan, non-goals, open
  questions.

  New `@ifc-lite/extensions/signing` module:

  - **Keys** — `generateKeyPair`, `exportPublicKey`, `exportPrivateKey`,
    `importPublicKey`, `importPrivateKey`, `fingerprintFromBytes`.
    Uses WebCrypto Ed25519 (Node ≥ 18.17, modern browsers). Keys
    serialise as `.iflk` JSON files with format/version/algorithm
    discriminator. Fingerprints are colon-separated SHA-256 of the
    raw 32-byte public key.
  - **Canonical hashing** — `canonicalContentHash` produces a
    deterministic SHA-256 over the bundle's file map. Insertion-order-
    independent; uses ASCII unit/record separators between
    path/bytes/record to make segment boundaries unambiguous.
  - **Sign / verify** — `signBundle` produces a `SignatureBlock`
    committed to the canonical hash. `verifyBundle` recomputes, checks
    format, imports key, runs `crypto.subtle.verify`. Throws
    `SignatureMismatchError` on any failure;
    `SignatureFormatError` for envelope-shape problems;
    `KeyFormatError` for malformed key files.

  `.iflx` envelope extension:

  - Optional `signature` field on pack / unpack.
  - `packBundle(bundle, signature?)` accepts a signature argument.
  - New `unpackBundleWithSignature(bytes)` returns
    `{ bundle, signature? }` so callers (loader, CLI) can verify and
    display the signer fingerprint.
  - Existing `unpackBundle` continues to work — signed bundles unpack
    fine, the signature is silently ignored. Backward-compatible.

  New CLI subcommands under `ifc-lite ext`:

  - `keygen --out <prefix> [--label <name>]` — Ed25519 keypair, writes
    `.public.iflk` and `.private.iflk`. Best-effort POSIX 0600 on the
    private file.
  - `pack <bundle-dir> [--out <bundle.iflx>] [--sign --key <private.iflk>]`
    — pack a bundle directory into `.iflx`, optionally signed.
  - `sign <bundle> --key <private.iflk> [--out <bundle.iflx>]` —
    attach a signature to an existing bundle (directory or unsigned
    `.iflx`).
  - `verify <bundle.iflx> [--key <public.iflk>] [--json]` — inspect
    a `.iflx`, optionally checking the signer matches an expected
    public key. JSON mode emits a structured envelope.

  Package-side housekeeping:

  - `packages/extensions/tsconfig.json`: added `"DOM"` to `lib` so
    WebCrypto types (`CryptoKey`, `CryptoKeyPair`) are available. Was
    already implicitly required for `crypto.subtle` calls in
    `storage/hash.ts`.
  - Top-level barrel exports the new signing surface.

  Tests: 333 (up from 307 / +26). New coverage: keypair generation
  identity, public/private key file round-trip, canonical hash
  determinism and order-independence, sign+verify happy path,
  content tamper detection, contentHash tamper, substituted public
  key, algorithm/format error paths, signed `.iflx` envelope
  round-trip, tamper detection through the pack→unpack→verify chain.
  Smoke-tested end-to-end against the canonical `good` bundle
  fixture.

  Plan tracked in `09-implementation-plan.md` — P5.T2 closed,
  P5.T1/T3-T8 remain gated on the registry decision.

  Critical / security fixes:

  - **`capability/match.ts`** — universal wildcard target no longer
    bypasses the required-target check. `model.mutate:*` now correctly
    refuses to cover `model.mutate` (no target). The two are
    structurally different and matching them would silently broaden
    authority. Regression test added.
  - **`signing/sign.ts` + `signing/verify.ts`** — `signedAt` is now
    cryptographically bound to the signature via a versioned
    domain-separated message (`iflx-sig\x1fv1\x1f<hash>\x1f<signedAt>`).
    Previously only `contentHash` was signed, so `signedAt` could be
    rewritten post-signing without detection. Regression test added.
  - **`signing/keys.ts`** — `importPrivateKey` now enforces
    `kind: 'private'` and wraps base64 / PKCS#8 parse errors in
    `KeyFormatError` rather than letting them bubble up as raw
    WebCrypto exceptions.
  - **`apps/viewer/src/services/extensions/host.ts`** — install path
    rejects `grantedCapabilities` not declared by the manifest (closes a
    grant-escalation hole if the review screen pre-filled stale state).
  - **`audit/log.ts`** — eviction now uses UTF-8 byte counts (via
    `TextEncoder.encode().byteLength`) instead of UTF-16 string length;
    records are deep-frozen on append so callers can't mutate stored
    events.
  - **`bundle/loader.ts`** — added a 16 MiB aggregate bundle cap during
    directory traversal so a thousand 4 MiB files can't OOM the loader.
  - **`bundle/iflx.ts`** — base64 decode is now strict (matches the
    base64 alphabet + correct padding) so Node's silently-lossy
    `Buffer.from(b64, 'base64')` no longer accepts corrupted bundles.
  - **`migrations/index.ts`** — `manifestVersion` validated as a
    positive integer (rejects `NaN`, `Infinity`, negatives, non-int
    doubles).
  - **`manifest/validate.ts`** — extension id regex dropped the `/i`
    flag so the validator actually enforces the lowercase canonical-id
    promise.
  - **`host/activation.ts`** — extension is marked `activated` only
    after listeners succeed (a throwing listener used to leave the
    extension permanently uneligible to retry). New `activating` flag
    guards against re-entrant double-dispatch.
  - **`host/runtime.ts`** — concurrent `activate()` calls for the same
    id are coalesced via an in-flight Promise map. Previously two
    overlapping calls could both build a sandbox and leak one.
  - **`inference/catalogue.ts`** + **`when/eval.ts`** — own-property
    checks instead of `in` / bracket access. Prototype-pollution-style
    lookups like `toString` now return undefined / no capability.
  - **`when/eval.ts`** — identifier lookup is gated by the v1 allow-list
    even if the context object happens to carry extra keys.

  Correctness / quality fixes:

  - **`apps/viewer/.../host.ts`** — `init()` only sets `initialized=true`
    after `loadAll` + `fire('onStartup')` succeed; uninstall explicitly
    deletes the bundle bytes; enable persists `enabled=true` only after
    the loader successfully brings the extension up (rolls back on
    failure); update path snapshots the previous record + bundle bytes
    and restores them if the new bundle fails to load.
  - **`idb-storage.ts`** — `onblocked` handler on
    `indexedDB.deleteDatabase` so the recovery rebuild can't hang
    forever when another tab holds a connection. Cascade bundle delete
    rewritten to use a dedicated transaction (the previous version's
    `onsuccess` got clobbered by the shared `runStore` helper).
  - **`ext-signing.ts`** — `verify --key <pub>` on an unsigned bundle
    now exits 2 (with structured error in `--json` mode) instead of
    passing silently. `keygen`'s chmod failure logs a warning so users
    on non-POSIX FS aren't quietly left with a 0644 private key.
  - **`bundle/iflx.ts`** — signature envelope re-parse failures log a
    warning instead of silently swallowing.
  - **`ExtensionsPanel.tsx`** — duplicate install submission guard
    (`busy` check in `handleApprove`); enable/disable/uninstall now
    catch rejections and surface a toast.
  - **`useInstalledExtensions.ts`** — `refresh()` wraps `listInstalled()`
    in try/catch (no more unhandled promise rejections).
  - **`useSlotContributions.ts`** — refreshes the snapshot synchronously
    when `host` or `slot` changes, so switching slots doesn't show
    stale contributions until the next registry event.
  - **`ExtensionHostProvider.tsx`** — async `init()` / `dispose()`
    failures are caught and logged.
  - **`sandbox-factory.ts`** — `JSON.stringify` failure in log
    marshalling logs the error instead of silently falling back.
  - **`ViewerLayout.tsx`** — mobile bottom sheet title and close
    handler now include the extensions panel (was missed in the UI
    batch).

  New tests:

  - `capability/match.test.ts` — universal wildcard does NOT cover
    target-less request.
  - `signing/signing.test.ts` — signedAt tamper detected by verify.
  - `host/activation.test.ts` — listener throw leaves extension
    activatable.
  - `host/runtime.test.ts` — concurrent activate() calls coalesce.

  Tests: 337 (up from 333 / +4).
