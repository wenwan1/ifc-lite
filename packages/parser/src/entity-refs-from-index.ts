/**
 * Synthesize `EntityRef[]` from a pre-built entity index (ids/starts/lengths
 * column arrays produced by the streaming geometry pre-pass) WITHOUT a
 * second WASM scan of the source.
 *
 * The pre-pass already walked the file once and emitted these three column
 * arrays; the parser worker reuses them so its own `scanEntitiesFastBytes`
 * call — which on a 986 MB / 14 M-entity file takes ~10 s under WASM
 * contention with the geometry workers — can be skipped entirely.
 *
 * Cost: ~1–2 s for 14 M entities. Almost all of it is the per-entity type
 * extraction (find `=`, find `(`, intern). Type interning hits ~99.99 % on
 * real IFC files (≈776 unique type names across 14 M entities) so we
 * allocate one JS string per unique type.
