## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1407](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1407) [`6af9dc2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6af9dc26f97f87237c27ae502c127e6170a80d64) Thanks [@Blogbotana](https://github.com/Blogbotana)! - Apply pending edits in merged (federated) export. `MergeModelInput` gains an optional
  `mutationView`; `MergedExporter.exportAsync` now bakes each model's edits (attribute /
  property / quantity / retype / positional mutations and overlay-created entities) into its
  source via `StepExporter` before merging, so federated export round-trips edits exactly like
  single-model export. Previously the merged path read raw source bytes and silently dropped
  every mutation — only single-model export reflected edits ([#1406](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1406)).

  Models without pending edits pass through unchanged (no export/parse cost). The synchronous
  `MergedExporter.export()` throws if a model carries pending edits, since baking needs the
  async parser. The viewer's "Merged (All Models)" export now passes each model's mutation view
  (gated by the Apply Mutations toggle).

  `MutablePropertyView` gains `hasPendingChanges()`, which reports the current overlay footprint
  (what the exporter would bake) rather than the append-only mutation history; the merged
  exporter uses it to decide whether to re-bake a model.

### Patch Changes

- [#1415](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1415) [`829b208`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/829b208735ef05f36c0bd3fc9ba802cc12cfcabb) Thanks [@Blogbotana](https://github.com/Blogbotana)! - Stop dropping shared property atoms when a property is edited. Editing a property replaces its
  property set and skips that set's member atoms wholesale; because exporters deduplicate shared
  `Pset_*Common` atoms (e.g. one `IsExternal` `IfcPropertySingleValue` referenced by dozens of
  psets), this orphaned every other pset referencing the atom, leaving dangling `#id` references —
  an invalid IFC that strict readers (e.g. BIM Vision) refuse to open. `StepExporter` now retains
  any atom still referenced by a surviving property set / element quantity; the edited pset still
  emits its replacement with the new value while shared atoms stay for the psets that keep their
  original. Fixes both single-model and merged export (the merged exporter bakes through
  `StepExporter`). ([#1413](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1413))

  Also stamp generated `IfcPropertySet` / `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` / `IfcElementQuantity`
  entities (emitted when a property/quantity is edited) with an existing `IfcOwnerHistory`
  instead of `$`. OwnerHistory is optional in IFC4 but **mandatory** in IFC2X3, so the previous
  `$` produced an invalid IFC2X3 file that strict readers (e.g. BIM Vision) reject. The exporter
  now reuses the model's owner history (falling back to `$` only when the file has none).

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1392](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1392) [`d38ee2f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d38ee2fb2e8003503600df261b0fd9aa1f279a4e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Make `MergedExporter` unit-aware so federating models with different length units no longer mis-scales geometry, and reconcile shared GlobalIds instead of emitting duplicates ([#1332](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1332)).

  Previously the merge folded every model into the first model's `IfcProject` and deduplicated its `IfcUnitAssignment`, so a second model's raw coordinates were silently reinterpreted under the first model's unit (e.g. a metre model read as feet, ≈3.28x off). Models that reused the same `GlobalId` for `IfcSite`/`IfcBuilding`/`IfcBuildingStorey` or products also produced duplicate-entity errors in strict viewers.

  Now:

  - A model that shares the first model's length unit is unified as before (single project, spatial structure and infrastructure deduplicated).
  - A model with a different length unit is **federated**: it keeps its own `IfcProject`, `IfcUnitAssignment` and representation contexts, so its coordinates stay correctly scaled. The output then contains more than one `IfcProject` only when units actually differ — an intentional, flagged relaxation of the `IfcSingleProjectInstance` rule that is strictly better than the previous silent mis-scale.
  - GlobalIds are reconciled, not blindly duplicated: a non-relationship rooted entity repeating a GlobalId already emitted **in the same unit space** is unified to the one instance. Otherwise it is kept and re-stamped with a fresh deterministic GlobalId — this preserves objectified relationships (`IfcRel*`), whose membership can differ even when the GlobalId matches, and prevents a unit-compatible model from being unified onto a federated (different-unit) instance.
  - Resource entities whose Name is coincidentally a 22-character GlobalId-charset string (properties, quantities, materials, styles, …) are no longer mistaken for rooted entities, so their values and names are never dropped or overwritten.

  The model's unit scale is read from `dataStore.lengthUnitScale` automatically. New `MergeModelInput.lengthUnitScale` lets callers override it, and a new `MergeExportOptions.unitReconciliation: 'auto' | 'assume-shared'` option (default `'auto'`) can force the pre-1332 single-project behaviour when the caller has already normalised units. `MergeExportResult.stats` now also reports `federatedModelCount` and `warnings` (the latter flags the multi-`IfcProject` conformance trade-off); the CLI `merge` command prints these warnings.

### Major Changes

- [#1242](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1242) [`fec82b9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/fec82b9f3eea3655f92413fce82387ddce2f9722) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add Rust-backed domain-format exporters. The new `ifc-lite-export` crate is the
  source of truth for Wavefront OBJ, glTF/GLB, CSV, JSON and JSON-LD (plus a
  native-only ara3d BOS/Parquet path). They are exposed via wasm
  (`exportObj`/`exportGlb`/`exportCsv`/`exportJson`/`exportJsonld`) and
  reachable from TypeScript through `GeometryProcessor.export*` and
  `IfcLiteBridge.export*`. Geometry exporters fold per-mesh RTC origin correctly (glTF
  emits it as a node translation, keeping f32 vertex precision at georef scale).

  STEP export also supports schema conversion (`IFC2X3`/`IFC4`/`IFC4X3`/`IFC5` entity-type
  renames + attribute trimming) and a mutation bridge — `exportStep` takes a `mutations_json`
  payload (`MutablePropertyView` attribute edits + property-set synthesis: new
  `IfcPropertySingleValue`/`IfcPropertySet`/`IfcRelDefinesByProperties` entities). New Rust exporters:
  **IFC5/IFCX** (`exportIfcx` — USD-style node graph: spatial hierarchy + classes + known
  IFC5 properties) and **Merged** (`exportMerged` — combine several models into one STEP,
  id-offset + project unification).

  The CLI `export` command gains `--format obj|gltf|glb|jsonld|step|ifcx` (Rust-backed;
  `--type`/`--storey`/`--where`/`--limit` act as the isolation set — for `step` the forward
  `#`-reference closure is added so a filtered export never dangles a reference; `--schema`
  converts entity types). The MCP `export_glb` tool is unstubbed, `export_ifcx` is unstubbed,
  and a new `export_obj` tool is added (all honour an optional `type` filter).

  Also makes the wasm geometry engine usable under Node: `IfcLiteBridge.init()` now reads
  the `.wasm` bytes itself when running in Node (whose `fetch()` cannot load `file://`),
  strictly Node-gated so the browser/worker path is unchanged. This additionally fixes
  headless `clash`/geometry commands that previously failed to initialize wasm in Node.

  The viewer's GLB export now assembles the binary in Rust over the meshes it already
  holds (`GeometryProcessor.exportGlbFromMeshes`, wasm `exportGlbFromMeshes`) instead of the
  TypeScript GLTFExporter — no re-meshing, and the per-element RTC origin rides a glTF node
  translation so georef-scale models keep vertex precision.

  **BREAKING (`@ifc-lite/export`):** `GLTFExporter`, `JSONLDExporter`, and `CSVExporter`
  (+ their option types) are removed — glTF/GLB, JSON-LD, and CSV are now produced in Rust. Use
  `GeometryProcessor.exportGlb` / `exportGlbFromMeshes`, `exportJsonld`, and
  `exportCsv(bytes, mode, …)` (mode ∈ `entities`|`properties`|`quantities`|`spatial`). All in-repo
  callers (viewer GLB / command-palette / mobile / location-map / main-toolbar CSV exports, LOD1
  generator) are migrated; the Rust CSV gained the spatial-hierarchy mode to match.

### Minor Changes

- [#1234](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1234) [`b6acbc4`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b6acbc4b84bcdb4a2d774515200d27edd7e831cb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add entity retype (reassign class) to the mutation overlay.

  `EntityTable` gains an additive `setTypeOverride(expressId, typeName | null)` so
  a host (the viewer) can reflect a pending retype live in `getTypeName` /
  `getTypeEnum` without rebuilding the table; the original columnar type is left
  intact.

  `StoreEditor.setEntityType(expressId, newType, { predefinedType? })` and
  `MutablePropertyView.setEntityType(...)` change an entity's IFC class in place,
  and a new `BulkAction { type: 'SET_ENTITY_TYPE', entityType, predefinedType? }`
  applies it to a selection. `StepExporter` materializes the retype on export.

  The entity keeps its expressId, so geometry, placement, representation and every
  `IfcRel*` reference (all keyed by `#id`) carry over unchanged. Attributes are
  re-laid-out by name against the target class's declared layout — dropping
  attributes the target lacks (e.g. IFC2X3 `CompositionType`) and validating
  `PredefinedType` against the target enum (an unknown override falls back to
  `USERDEFINED` + `ObjectType`). This mirrors IfcOpenShell's
  `ifcopenshell.util.schema.reassign_class`. Intended for compatible
  reassignments such as the building-element subtypes that share the IfcElement
  layout (`IfcBuildingElementProxy` ↔ `IfcColumn`/`IfcBeam`/`IfcMember`/
  `IfcPlate`/`IfcWall`).

### Minor Changes

- [#1143](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1143) [`248f2c0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/248f2c09a4d61fa27dfeaba5511a2a641d4cd278) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Preserve source IFC HEADER fields on round-trip export. Re-exporting an
  imported file previously regenerated a fresh ifc-lite header, silently dropping
  the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items (any `ViewDefinition [...]` label and vendor
  identifier / coordinate-reference strings) and flattening the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token (e.g. `IFC4X3_ADD2` → `IFC4X3`, which some toolchains
  reject).

  The parser now captures the verbatim HEADER onto a new
  `IfcDataStore.sourceHeader` (`IfcSourceHeader`, exported from `@ifc-lite/data`;
  parser also exports `parseSourceHeader`), threaded through the worker transport.
  `StepExporter` reproduces the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items and the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token when not converting schemas, falling back to parsing the
  source bytes for cache-restored stores. Provenance stays honest:
  `preprocessor_version` is set to `ifc-lite` while the source authoring tool is
  kept as `originating_system`, and when mutations exist exactly one
  `Re-exported by ifc-lite, N modification(s)` item is appended without removing
  the source items. `generateHeader` now accepts description/author/organization
  arrays plus a free-form schema token and STEP-escapes all fields; it also emits
  a properly parenthesised `FILE_DESCRIPTION` list (the prior single-string form
  was malformed STEP). Created-from-scratch (`IfcCreator`) and federated/merged
  exports are unaffected — they keep their own provenance headers by design.

### Patch Changes

- [#1116](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1116) [`49778b1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/49778b179826d46e1c96361fe7b557e42db4ecfe) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix STEP exporters dropping deferred property atoms, which produced hundreds of thousands of dangling `#`-references in merged (and single-model) IFC output.

  On large files the parser can move high-cardinality property atoms (`IfcPropertySingleValue`, `IfcQuantity*`, `IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue`, …) out of `entityIndex.byId` into a secondary `deferredEntityIndex` to cap memory (`deferPropertyAtomIndex`). Every other consumer (on-demand property/material extraction) reads through the `byId.get(id) ?? deferredEntityIndex.get(id)` fallback, but `MergedExporter` and `StepExporter` walked `byId` alone. They therefore emitted the `IfcPropertySet` / `IfcElementQuantity` _containers_ while silently dropping the atoms those containers reference — leaving the STEP output full of references to entities that are never defined. Strict viewers (e.g. BIM Vision) reject such files, and lenient ones fall geometry back to the origin when a placement / type / material chain resolves to a dropped entity.

  Both exporters now iterate the complete entity set via a shared `getCompleteEntityIndex` helper (primary index + deferred atoms), and the merge offset / new-id allocation now spans deferred ids too so remapped ids can't collide with a deferred atom sitting at a higher express id. When nothing was deferred the primary index is returned unchanged, so the common path keeps its existing behaviour and cost.

## 1.19.7

### Patch Changes

- [#1114](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1114) [`16d87f2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/16d87f201dfd7d4cba46bb43e0f4a44ccce717bb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Per-element local frame: eliminate f32 "fan" corruption on building-scale and georeferenced models.

  When a mesh is stored at f32 precision while its vertices sit at building-scale world coordinates (a model whose extent reaches ~200 m from the coordinate origin), the f32 mantissa only resolves ~15 µm there, so vertices closer than one ULP collapse to the same value and the triangles joining them fan out as long needles across the model. Lowering the global RTC threshold is the wrong lever (it is reserved for >10 km federation re-basing), and a single global recentre still leaves the model genuinely spanning ~200 m.

  Each element's vertices are now stored RELATIVE to a per-element `MeshData.origin` (the f64 AABB centre, snapped to the kernel reconcile grid `1/65536 m`), so the f32 coordinates stay element-small and collapse-free at any building or georef scale; the world position is `origin + position`. The renderer reconstructs world space with a per-batch model-matrix translate around a single shared scene origin (so abutting elements in different colour batches stay bit-coincident with no seam z-fighting), and the selection-highlight / GPU-picker buffers replicate the batch's exact f32 path so highlights are bit-coincident with no depth bias. The local frame is ON for the wasm (viewer) path and opt-in for native/server, so determinism snapshots and server output stay absolute-coordinate byte-identical.

  Every world-space consumer of element geometry now folds `origin` (`world = origin + position`): camera/scene bounds, the CPU raycast + BVH narrow phase, snap detection, the section cutters (CPU + GPU), the BIM↔scan deviation BVH, the spatial index, clash (world-frame triangles fed to both the TS and Rust kernels), the glTF / IFC5 / Parquet exporters, the Cesium GLB overlay, the construction-projection outline + storey-band derivation, and the federation alignment / mesh-duplicate paths. `MeshData.origin` is serialized in the geometry cache (format version 6, which auto-heals stale entries). Position differences (normals, edge vectors, areas) are origin-invariant and unchanged.

  This composes with the sub-grid sliver hygiene pass: the local frame removes the f32-storage fans, and `Mesh::clean_degenerate` removes the sub-grid slivers the finer-grained CSG host emits.

### Patch Changes

- [#1071](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1071) [`891efef`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/891efef5fa9fca04bf2e01be9a1de04bbb84aafe) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Client/server alignment fixes:

  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `IfcCreator` now generates spec-valid 128-bit GlobalIds via the canonical `@ifc-lite/encoding` encoder (previously ~94% of generated ids failed `isValidIfcGuid` and silently changed identity on guid→uuid→guid round-trips, e.g. in BCF).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: schema-downgrade `IFCPROXY` placeholders now carry spec-valid GlobalIds instead of synthetic `PROXY_…` markers.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractLengthUnitScale` now mirrors the canonical Rust extractor when an `IfcMeasureWithUnit` ValueComponent is unreadable — defaults the value to 1.0 and still applies the UnitComponent SI-prefix instead of falling through to metres (property scaling can no longer desync from geometry scaling).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: removed the dead legacy worker protocol (`process`/`prepass`/`prepass-fast` messages) — the streaming protocol (`stream-start`/`stream-chunk`/`stream-end` + `prepass-streaming`) is the only path; the wasm `buildPrePassFast` export is gone. Streaming pre-pass loads now apply aggregate void propagation (window/door cuts on aggregated parts) in parity with one-shot loads and the server.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ProcessingStats` gains optional `total_csg_failures` / `products_with_failures` fields — the server now reports the same CSG failure diagnostics the browser console shows.

- [#1071](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1071) [`891efef`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/891efef5fa9fca04bf2e01be9a1de04bbb84aafe) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Client surface alignment (audit follow-ups):

  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ServerConfig.token` sends `Authorization: Bearer` on every request (servers running `IFC_SERVER_API_TOKEN` were unreachable from the TS client); the `ParseResponse` / `ProcessingStats` / `MeshData` mirrors gain the optional fields the Rust server actually serves (`mesh_coordinate_space`, transforms, scan/lookup/preprocess timings, mesh metadata).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the worker-pool converter now carries `shadingColor` across the worker boundary — GLB "Shading" export no longer degrades on the default (parallel) load path; dead legacy wasm bindings removed (`IfcAPI.parse`, `parseStreaming`, `scanRelevantEntitiesFastBytes`, `MeshCollection.localToWorld`).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: `assembleStepBytes` deduplicated into `step-serialization` (was copied byte-for-byte in the STEP and merged exporters).

  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the

  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

  Both GLB importers (`parseGLBToMeshData` in `@ifc-lite/cache` and the
  secondary one in `@ifc-lite/export`) hardcoded
  `color: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0]` on every mesh and never looked at

  (IFC → GLB → re-import as model) silently lost all colour and the
  viewport went grey.

  Fix: resolve each primitive's `material` index against the glTF
  `materials` array and copy `baseColorFactor` into `MeshData.color`,
  keeping the previous grey as the fallback when a primitive has no
  material (e.g. third-party glTFs). Regression tests added in both
  packages cover the round-trip and the no-material fallback.

### Minor Changes

- [#688](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/688) [`d0ba541`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d0ba541dda3936b985c2189fbca4300cbb89df91) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add GLB export dialog with colour-source selection and visibility
  filtering (PR [#688](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/688)).

  The new `GLBExportDialog` in the viewer replaces the inline GLB
  export handler in `MainToolbar` with a dedicated dialog. Features:

  - **Model picker** for federated multi-model scenes.
  - **Colour source** selector: "Rendering" (the apparent display
    colour — `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering.DiffuseColour` if authored,
    falling back to `IfcSurfaceStyleShading.SurfaceColour`) or
    "Shading" (the raw `SurfaceColour`, only available when the file
    authored a distinct `DiffuseColour`).
  - **Visible-only filter** that respects the viewer's hidden /
    isolated entity sets. Mesh-vs-set comparison runs in global ID
    space so federated models with non-zero `idOffset` filter
    correctly.
  - **Metadata inclusion** toggle for IFC GlobalId / type / name
    side-tables.

  Pipeline changes underneath:

  - `MeshData` / `MeshDataJs` carry an optional `shadingColor`
    alongside `color`. The Rust styling module now extracts both
    `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering.DiffuseColour` (rendering) and
    `IfcSurfaceStyleShading.SurfaceColour` (shading) in a single
    pre-pass and returns them as separate maps; `shadingColor` is
    only populated when it actually differs from the rendering
    colour, so memory cost stays sparse on the common case.
  - The streaming geometry path
    (`convertMeshCollectionToBatch`) and the worker collector
    (`IfcLiteMeshCollector`) both copy `shadingColor` end-to-end so
    the dialog's "Shading" source works on every load path, not just
    the batch path.
  - `GLTFExporter` gains `colorSource`, `visibleOnly`,
    `hiddenEntityIds`, and `isolatedEntityIds` options. Visibility
    filtering compares mesh `expressId` (global) against the dialog-
    supplied sets (also global) — no offset arithmetic in the
    exporter.

be a SharedArrayBuffer` when the data store's source buffer is SAB-backed.
  Both `StepExporter` and `MergedExporter` now route all source-byte decodes
  through `safeUtf8Decode` from `@ifc-lite/data`, which transparently copies
  into a scratch buffer on the (Firefox / Chrome-with-mitigation) runtimes
  that reject `TextDecoder.decode()` on `SharedArrayBuffer` views.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `StepExporter` improvements for the overlay-driven add/duplicate/edit flow.

  - Overlay-created entities (`view.createEntity()` / `store.addEntity()`)
    now respect `includeGeometry: false` and the `visibleOnly` /
    `allowedEntityIds` closure — same filters that already apply to
    source entities. Without this a freshly-added wall would smuggle
    its `IfcCartesianPoint`/`IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` helpers past
    `exportPropertiesOnly()`.
  - `deltaOnly` mode now keeps overlay-created entities even when no
    other modifications exist — the early-return predicate consults
    `mutationView.getNewEntities()` and `newGeorefLines` so a
    `createEntity()`-only edit isn't silently dropped from the
    delta. Regression test
    (`emits overlay-created entities under deltaOnly when no other
modifications exist`) locks this behaviour in.
  - `serializeStepArgs` / `serializeStepValue` are exported from
    `@ifc-lite/export/step-serialization` so the overlay-emit path
    and the rest of the codebase share one canonical STEP-formatting
    implementation.

  New `Ifc5Exporter` converts IFC data from any schema (IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3) to the IFC5 IFCX JSON format:

  - Entity types converted to IFC5 naming (aligned with IFC4X3)
  - Properties mapped to IFCX attribute namespaces (`bsi::ifc::prop::`)
  - Tessellated geometry converted to USD mesh format with Z-up coordinates
  - Spatial hierarchy mapped to IFCX path-based node structure
  - Color and presentation exported as USD attributes

  The export dialog is simplified: schema selection now drives the output format automatically (IFC5 → `.ifcx`, others → `.ifc`). No separate format picker needed.

  Schema converter fixes:

  - Skipped entities become IFCPROXY placeholders instead of being dropped, preventing dangling STEP references
  - Alignment entities (IFCALIGNMENTCANT, etc.) are preserved for IFC4X3/IFC5 targets

- [#211](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/211) [`0b6880a`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b6880ac9bafee78e8b604e8df5a8e14dc74bc28) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Improve IFC export with visible-only filtering, material preservation, and full schema coverage

  - **Visible-only export**: Single-model export now correctly filters hidden entities (fixes `__legacy__` model ID handling)
  - **Material preservation**: Multi-model merged export preserves colors and materials by collecting `IfcStyledItem` entities via reverse reference pass
  - **Full IFC schema coverage**: Expanded product type classification from ~30 hand-curated types to 202 schema-derived types (IFC4 + IFC4X3), covering all `IfcProduct` subtypes including infrastructure (bridges, roads, railways, marine facilities)
  - **Orphaned opening removal**: Hidden elements' openings are automatically excluded via `IfcRelVoidsElement` propagation
  - **Performance**: Replaced `TextDecoder` + regex with byte-level `#ID` scanning and `byType` index lookups for style/opening collection (~95% fewer iterations)

## 1.7.0

### Patch Changes

- [#200](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/200) [`6c43c70`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6c43c707ead13fc482ec367cb08d847b444a484a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add schema-aware property editing, full property panel display, and document/relationship support

  - Property editor validates against IFC4 standard (ISO 16739-1:2018): walls get wall psets, doors get door psets, etc.
  - Schema-version-aware property editing: detects IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3 from FILE_SCHEMA header
  - New dialogs for adding classifications (12 standard systems), materials, and quantities in edit mode
  - Quantity set definitions (Qto\_) with schema-aware dialog for standard IFC4 base quantities
  - On-demand classification extraction from IfcRelAssociatesClassification with chain walking
  - On-demand material extraction supporting all IFC material types: IfcMaterial, IfcMaterialLayerSet, IfcMaterialProfileSet, IfcMaterialConstituentSet, IfcMaterialList, and \*Usage wrappers
  - On-demand document extraction from IfcRelAssociatesDocument with DocumentReference→DocumentInformation chain
  - Type-level property merging: properties from IfcTypeObject HasPropertySets merged with instance properties
  - Structural relationship display: openings, fills, groups, and connections
  - Advanced property type parsing: IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue, BoundedValue, ListValue, TableValue, ReferenceValue
  - Georeferencing display (IfcMapConversion + IfcProjectedCRS) in model metadata panel
  - Length unit display in model metadata panel
  - Classifications, materials, documents displayed with dedicated card components
  - Type-level material/classification inheritance via IfcRelDefinesByType
  - Relationship graph fallback for server-loaded models without on-demand maps
  - Cycle detection in material resolution and classification chain walking
  - Removed `any` types from parser production code in favor of proper `PropertyValue` union type

- Updated dependencies [[`e0af898`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/e0af898608c2f706dc2d82154c612c64e2de010c), [`6c43c70`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6c43c707ead13fc482ec367cb08d847b444a484a)]:
